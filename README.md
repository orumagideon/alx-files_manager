## Tasks

### 0. Redis utils

**Repo:** GitHub repository: alx-files_manager  
**File:** utils/redis.js

Inside the folder utils, create a file `redis.js` that contains the class `RedisClient`.

`RedisClient` should have:

- The constructor that creates a client to Redis:
  - Any error of the Redis client must be displayed in the console (you should use `on('error')` of the Redis client)
- A function `isAlive` that returns true when the connection to Redis is a success otherwise, false
- An asynchronous function `get` that takes a string key as argument and returns the Redis value stored for this key
- An asynchronous function `set` that takes a string key, a value, and a duration in seconds as arguments to store it in Redis (with an expiration set by the duration argument)
- An asynchronous function `del` that takes a string key as argument and removes the value in Redis for this key

After the class definition, create and export an instance of `RedisClient` called `redisClient`.

### 1. MongoDB utils

**Repo:** GitHub repository: alx-files_manager  
**File:** utils/db.js

Inside the folder utils, create a file `db.js` that contains the class `DBClient`.

`DBClient` should have:

- The constructor that creates a client to MongoDB:
  - Host: from the environment variable DB_HOST or default: localhost
  - Port: from the environment variable DB_PORT or default: 27017
  - Database: from the environment variable DB_DATABASE or default: files_manager
- A function `isAlive` that returns true when the connection to MongoDB is a success otherwise, false
- An asynchronous function `nbUsers` that returns the number of documents in the collection users
- An asynchronous function `nbFiles` that returns the number of documents in the collection files

After the class definition, create and export an instance of `DBClient` called `dbClient`.

### 2. First API

**Repo:** GitHub repository: alx-files_manager  
**Files:** server.js, routes/index.js, controllers/AppController.js

Inside `server.js`, create the Express server:

- It should listen on the port set by the environment variable PORT or by default 5000
- It should load all routes from the file `routes/index.js`

Inside the folder `routes`, create a file `index.js` that contains all endpoints of the API:

- `GET /status => AppController.getStatus`
- `GET /stats => AppController.getStats`

Inside the folder `controllers`, create a file `AppController.js` that contains the definition of the 2 endpoints:

- `GET /status` should return if Redis is alive and if the DB is alive too by using the 2 utils created previously: `{ "redis": true, "db": true }` with a status code 200
- `GET /stats` should return the number of users and files in DB: `{ "users": 12, "files": 1231 }` with a status code 200

### 3. Create a new user

**Repo:** GitHub repository: alx-files_manager  
**Files:** utils/, routes/index.js, controllers/UsersController.js

In the file `routes/index.js`, add a new endpoint:

- `POST /users => UsersController.postNew`

Inside `controllers`, add a file `UsersController.js` that contains the new endpoint:

- `POST /users` should create a new user in DB:
  - To create a user, you must specify an email and a password
  - If the email is missing, return an error "Missing email" with a status code 400
  - If the password is missing, return an error "Missing password" with a status code 400
  - If the email already exists in DB, return an error "Already exist" with a status code 400
  - The password must be stored after being hashed in SHA1
  - The endpoint is returning the new user with only the email and the id (auto-generated by MongoDB) with a status code 201
  - The new user must be saved in the collection users:
    - Email: same as the value received
    - Password: SHA1 value of the value received

### 4. Authenticate a user

**Repo:** GitHub repository: alx-files_manager  
**Files:** utils/, routes/index.js, controllers/UsersController.js, controllers/AuthController.js

In the file `routes/index.js`, add 3 new endpoints:

- `GET /connect => AuthController.getConnect`
- `GET /disconnect => AuthController.getDisconnect`
- `GET /users/me => UserController.getMe`

Inside `controllers`, add a file `AuthController.js` that contains new endpoints:

- `GET /connect` should sign-in the user by generating a new authentication token
- `GET /disconnect` should sign-out the user based on the token
- `GET /users/me` should retrieve the user based on the token used

### 5. First file
